        </p>
        <div class="image">

            <div class="description"></div>
          </div>
        <p>
            
            The Maya were skilled mathematicians and astronomers. They developed a complex calendar system that was more accurate than the one used in Europe during the Middle Ages. They also tracked the movements of the sun, moon, and planets with great precision.
            
        </p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="/img/Mexico/42.jpg" alt="Image 1" />
            <div class="description"></div>
          </div>
        <p>
            The Maya built massive pyramids and other architectural structures, many of which still stand today. The most famous of these is the Temple of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza, which was built to align with the movements of the sun and the stars.
        </p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="/img/Mexico/40.jpg" alt="Image 1" />
            <div class="description"></div>
          </div>
        <p>
            The Maya were skilled artists and craftspeople. They created intricate carvings, sculptures, and pottery that were both beautiful and functional. They also developed a complex writing system that was used to record history, mythology, and everyday life.
        </p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="/img/Mexico/45.jpeg" alt="Image 1" />
            <div class="description"></div>
          </div>
        <p>
            The Maya were a highly organized society, with a complex system of government and social hierarchy. They had a powerful ruling class of kings, nobles, and priests who controlled the society's wealth and resources.
        </p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="/img/Mexico/47.jpg" alt="Image 1" />
            <div class="description"></div>
          </div>
        <p>
            The Maya were skilled farmers and engineers. They developed complex irrigation systems to water their crops, and built terraces and dams to control the flow of water. They also developed a system of raised fields that allowed them to grow crops on otherwise unproductive land.
        </p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="/img/Mexico/46.jpg" alt="Image 1" />
            <div class="description"></div>
          </div>
        <p>
            The decline of the Maya civilization is a mystery. Many theories have been proposed, including overpopulation, environmental degradation, and internal conflict. But the exact cause of the collapse remains unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, the Maya civilization was one of the most advanced and sophisticated cultures of the pre-Columbian Americas. Their achievements in math, astronomy, architecture, art, and government continue to amaze and inspire us today.
