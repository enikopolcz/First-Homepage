      <div class="content2">
        <p>
            Transylvania, a region located in present-day Romania, has a long and complex history that is deeply intertwined with that of Hungary. Both countries have laid claim to the region for centuries, and their relationship has been marked by both cooperation and conflict.
        </p>

      <div class="content2">
        <p>
            One of the most significant events in the history of Transylvania was the Treaty of Trianon, which was signed in 1920 following the end of World War I. Under the terms of the treaty, Transylvania was ceded to Romania, a decision that was met with great resistance from many ethnic Hungarians living in the region.
         <br><br>   This decision had a profound impact on the relationship between Hungary and Romania, and it would ultimately lead to further conflict during World War II. During the war, Hungary, under the leadership of Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy, sought to regain control of Transylvania and other territories that it had lost after World War I.
         <br><br>  The outcome of the WWII was a disaster for the Hungarian community in Transylvania, as it was subjected to forced population transfers and ethnic cleansing. Many Hungarians were forcibly expelled from the region, and the remainder were subjected to persecution and discrimination under the communist regime that took control of Romania after the war.

        <p>
            Today, the relationship between Hungary and Romania is much more peaceful, but the legacy of the past still looms large. Transylvania remains a region of great cultural and historical significance for both countries, and it is a place where the complexities of their shared history are on full display.

            It is a reminder of the tragic consequences of nationalism fervor and territorial disputes. The forced displacement of people, the persecution and atrocities committed on the basis of ethnic identity, are all important lessons that should not be forgotten. It's important to remember and acknowledge the past, but also to work towards a more peaceful and cooperative future for all the people of Transylvania and the region.
