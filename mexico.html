      <h4>Backpacking Through The Caribbean</h4>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          Last summer in 2022, my partner and I made the spontaneous decision to
          pack our bags, buy a one-way ticket to Mexico, and embark on a new
          adventure. considering that checked baggage would have cost twice as
          much as the flight itself, we decided to take only one backpack. This
          seemed scary at first, that I'm moving almost 10,000 kilometres away
          for an indefinite period of time and have just a backpack. Plus, my
          backpack was a smaller kind of backpack so what was in it was: laptop,
          chargers, 1 swimsuit, 1 pair of pants, 3 pairs of underwear,
          travel-sized toiletries, and I think a pair of slippers. We planned to
          buy clothes at H&M there because it still would be cheaper than the
          language, but believe it or not, we ended up buying almost nothing.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="title">need a little luck</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          Our journey took us to the Yucatan Peninsula, where we stayed for
          almost two months in a small community called Puerto Aventuras. This
          charming coastal town, located just south of Cancun, offered the
          perfect blend of relaxation and adventure. From its pristine beaches
          to its vibrant culture, Puerto Aventuras quickly won us over and
          became our home away from home. <br />
          One thing must be said about this trip before any questions arise. My
          travels have always been on a small budget, given that I was a student
          when I started travelling, I never had an endless budget. This trip
          would have been the most expensive, and we would not have been able to
          finance the accommodation on our own. We were in the fortunate
          position that my partner's aunt had relocated from the US to Puerto
          Aventuras, and we were able to stay with her for free while we
          explored the peninsula. Now that we've cleared that up, here's a
          little taster. As far as accommodation is concerned, you can also find
          budget accommodation on Airbnb, but you will have to accept the fact
          that you will be staying in a more modest area and not necessarily in
          a luxury suite. But at least there will be 3 padlocks on the inside of
          the door. (Like on our door during our last week in Cancun...more on
          that later).

      <div class="title">Off-season is better</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          We arrived in Puerto Aventuras in August and stayed until almost the
          end of October, which happened to be off-season. While this meant that
          we didn't have the opportunity to meet as many travellers as we would
          have during peak season, we actually enjoyed the peacefulness and
          quiet that came with it. During our time there, we did have the chance
          to meet a few other travellers, as well as some retirees from the US
          who had chosen to make Puerto Aventuras their home. We visited several
          stunning beaches and soak up the sun. One thing that I can say for
          sure is that the Mexican beaches are just as beautiful as you can see
          in the pictures. From the turquoise blue water to the white sandy
          beaches, it was truly a sight to behold. However, there was one thing
          that was not as aesthetically pleasing and that was the sea grass or
          "sargassum" as they call it. This type of seaweed washed up on the
          shore and accumulated in certain areas, which was not a pretty sight.

      <div class="title">There is no such thing as free tequila!</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          As we visited the famous destinations like Cancun and Tulum, the
          beaches were just as beautiful as we expected. Everywhere we went,
          there was a burst of colours and vibrant energy. However, it quickly
          became clear that we were targets for scammers. The phrase "there's no
          such thing as a free lunch" certainly applies to Mexico, where we
          found that things were often more expensive than they appeared. From
          the "free" tequila that came with hidden costs, to the constant
          distractions and inflated prices in shops, it felt like everything was
          a trap. It was frustrating to find that even something as simple as
          buying a single item could end up costing twice as much on different
          days, and the lack of receipts made it difficult to dispute the
          charges. We must have spent an extra $100 a week because of the scams.

      <div class="title">Into the unexpected</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          What I love most about travelling, apart from seeing the world, is the
          unexpected situations life throws you into. As part of our journey
          through Mexico, we made our way to the island of Cozumel. This
          beautiful island is located in the Caribbean Sea and is known for its
          stunning beaches and crystal-clear waters. It's a popular destination
          for tourists, especially for those looking to enjoy the best of
          Mexico's natural beauty. One interesting fact about Cozumel is that it
          is home to the second largest coral reef system in the world, after
          the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. This makes it a popular
          destination for snorkeling and diving, as visitors can explore the
          vibrant underwater world and witness a diverse array of marine life.
          Our time on the island was truly a highlight of our trip. The
          atmosphere was relaxed and calm, and the beaches were serene and
          peaceful. We spent our days exploring the island, enjoying the
          beautiful scenery and soaking up the sun. The island's lush
          vegetation, turquoise waters, and stunning sunsets made for a truly
          unforgettable experience.

      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          As part of our travel to Cozumel we visited an ancient Mayan ruin on
          the Island. While it was fascinating to see this historical place, it
          also ended up being one of the biggest scams we encountered during our
          trip. Upon arriving, we were required to buy an entrance ticket just
          to reach the second entrance, where we then had to pay again for the
          actual entry into the site. This double-charging system left us
          feeling frustrated and angry, especially when I asked if it was
          possible to take drone footage. They said no. I accepted of course.
          Then they ran after us and told us to give them our drone for
          safekeeping. I speak Italian, not Spanish, but at that point my hidden
          Spanish came out and I made it clear that I would certainly not give
          them my drone, not even for safekeeping, but rest assured, I would not
          take it out. The interesting thing was that they didn't resist. So
          they were just trying to see if I would give it to them, but by then
          we had fallen victim so many times that we had learned our lesson.

      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          We have been warned that mosquitoes bite very badly and if we don't
          have mosquito repellent, they will spray us. One spray cost a dollar
          per body part. By then I was totally freaked out, so I didn't even ask
          for it. A friend of our sprayed himself for $10. They were right about
          one thing that day: the mosquitoes were really biting! As we didn't
          have our own mosquito killer, I was eaten by mosquitoes, there was
          practically not a square millimetre of my skin that wasn't bitten.
          Take a mosquito repellent with you anyway! The funniest thing is that
          my partner wasn't stung at all.

      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          Visiting Mexico and trying out their famous spicy tacos was a must-do
          for us. However, we soon realized that Mexican cuisine can be
          deceiving even for those who are used to spicy food. Despite our
          confidence in our tolerance for hot stuff, after a week of indulging
          in spicy tacos, our stomachs were in ruins and we suffered for several
          days. It’s important to heed the warning and pace yourself when it
          comes to Mexican food, as it can be tough on even the strongest of
          stomachs. Don’t let the delicious flavours fool you, it’s always
          better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your health.

        <p>
          The last couple days of staying in Mexico was a total disaster. As we
          had to leave the ”auntie-hotel” sooner than expected, we booked the
          cheapest flight we found back to Europe, but we still had to spend 4
          days in Cancun. We quickly booked a "studio apartment" on Airbnb. It
          was in the middle of the ghetto in Cancun. This was totally our fault,
          because in hurry we did not checked the surroundings. But the place
          was not looking like as they promised in photos. Actually there was a
          hole in the roof was covered by a lattice that could easily fit a
          medium-sized animal. And here come the padlocks! “Fortunately” there
          were 3 huge padlocks on the inside of the door. I freaked out, why do
          we need this? So we left immediately. We wrote a letter of complaint
          to Airbnb, who immediately refunded half of the booking fee. Then we
          didn't want to take any chances, so we booked a hotel room. I thought
          the hotel category was more reliable and less likely to disappoint. I
          was wrong. This disappointment was the same as the last one, only
          worse, because by then we were completely exhausted. We spent four
          awful days in Hotel Caribe International Cancun in a room where the AC
          was broken, there was no refrigerator, not to mention the bugs and the
          pervasive smell. We complained but seemed no one cares, they said we
          could leave if we are not satisfied, but refund in not available and
          given that we had already spent a lot of money on the previous
          accommodation and only got half of it back, we couldn't afford to lose
          this too. So 4 terrible days followed, after which we finally returned
          to our home.

        <p>
          Even though we experienced a lot of scams and negative things, I still
          fell in love with this place. Our trip was a mixture of good and bad
          experiences, but it taught me a lot and I am grateful for that. I now
          know to be more cautious and aware of my surroundings. I won't fall
          into the same traps again. I also learned to appreciate the small
          things in life, like the feeling of being relaxed and calm on the
          island of Cozumel. Despite all the negative experiences, I would still
          return to Mexico in a heartbeat. The country has a special place in my
          heart and I can't wait to go back and explore more of its beauty. I am
          wiser now and I know what to expect, but that won't stop me from
          enjoying the vibrant culture and delicious food of this amazing
          country. So the answer is yes!
