            The most well-known Italian mafia is the Sicilian Mafia, also known as Cosa Nostra.
            The origins of the Sicilian Mafia can be traced back to the mid-19th century in Sicily, Italy and has been involved in activities such as extortion, drug trafficking, and money laundering.
            The Italian government has taken steps to combat the mafia, including passing laws that make it easier to prosecute mafia members and seize their assets.
            The "Maxi Trial" in the 1980s was a major effort by the Italian government to prosecute high-level members of the Sicilian Mafia, resulting in many convictions.

            'ndrangheta, a criminal organization in Calabria, and the Camorra ( La Gamorra in Italian) from the Campania region are considered to be two of the most powerful and richest mafia in the world.
            The 'Ndrangheta is known for its strict code of silence, or omertà, which makes it difficult for law enforcement to gather information on its activities.
            The code of conduct, also known as the 'code of silence' or 'omerta', is one of the defining characteristics of the Italian Mafia. It is a strict set of rules that dictate the behaviour and actions of its members, and it is considered to be one of the key reasons for the organization's longevity and success. The code of conduct emphasizes loyalty, secrecy, and violence, and members who violate it face severe consequences. It is this code that has helped the Mafia maintain its power and control over its members, and it is what has allowed the organization to persist despite numerous attempts by law enforcement to dismantle it.
            However, the code of conduct also highlights the brutal and oppressive nature of the Mafia, and it serves as a reminder of the organization's dark history. Despite its code of conduct, the Mafia is still involved in a wide range of criminal activities, including racketeering, extortion, and murder. The code of conduct may have served as a means of maintaining order within the organization, but it has also perpetuated its criminal behaviour.

      <div class="content2">
        <p>
            Criminal organizations like the Italian Mafia have faced challenges and faced decline over time due to increased law enforcement efforts, internal power struggles, and changes in society. While the Mafia may adapt and evolve in response to these challenges, it is uncertain whether it will continue to exist in the same form as it has in the past.
            Ultimately, the longevity of the Mafia will depend on a range of factors, including the effectiveness of law enforcement, societal attitudes towards organized crime, and the ability of the organization to adapt and evolve in response to changing circumstances. However, as long as there is a demand for illegal goods and services, and as long as there are individuals willing to participate in criminal activities, the threat of organized crime will likely persist in some form.
