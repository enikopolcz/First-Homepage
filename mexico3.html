            Mexico has long been plagued by powerful drug cartels that engage in illegal activities such as drug trafficking, extortion, and violence. <br> These organizations have had a significant impact on Mexico's security and economy, and have caused a great deal of suffering for the Mexican people.
         <br><br>   One recent event that brought international attention to the issue of drug cartels in Mexico is the killing of the son of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán, the notorious leader of the Sinaloa cartel. On November 4th, 2019, the son, Iván Archivaldo Guzmán Salazar, and his brother Jesús Alfredo, were kidnapped and killed by a rival gang in the city of Culiacán, Sinaloa. This event sparked a series of violent clashes between different criminal groups and security forces in the region, leaving at least 13 dead and dozens injured.

        <p>
            The increasing violence and power of drug cartels in Mexico have had a devastating impact on the country and its citizens. The government has made efforts to combat the cartels, but the problem persists, and the violence and crime associated with the cartels continue to be a major concern for the people of Mexico.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drug cartels in Mexico have also been known to be involved in money laundering, human trafficking and corruption, making it a threat to the society and economy of the country. <br> The Mexican government has been trying to combat this issue by implementing policies such as extradition of high-profile criminals to the United States, increasing the budget of the security forces, and launching operations to capture or kill cartel leaders.
        </p>

          </div>
        <p>
            It is important to note that drug cartels are complex criminal organizations that involve multiple actors, and the solutions to combat them are not simple. <br> The fight against drug cartels requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach that involves cooperation between different levels of government, civil society, and the private sector. <br> The situation in Mexico remains a concern for the international community and it is important to keep following the developments and the actions taken to combat this issue.
