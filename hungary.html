      <h4>Discovering the Beauty of my Homeland</h4>

      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          As a Hungarian, let me introduce my home for you. I will not only
          write about the famous sights, but also about places that less people
          know...yet! From the bustling capital city of Budapest to the rolling
          hills of the countryside, there is always something new and exciting
          to discover in Hungary. One of the most fascinating aspects of Hungary
          is its history, which stretches back thousands of years. From the
          Roman Empire to the Ottoman occupation, Hungary has been shaped by a
          diverse array of cultures and influences. Another unique aspect of
          Hungary is its cuisine you may have heard about. Hungarian cuisine is
          renowned for its hearty dishes, rich flavours, and unique spices. Some
          of the most famous dishes include goulash, chimney cake, and
          Hungarian-style stuffed peppers.
        </p>

      <div class="title">Myths around Budapest</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          Beyond the historical landmarks and tourist attractions, there are
          also some intriguing myths and legends associated with out capital
          city. One of the most well-known myths is about the Buda Castle Hill
          and the Fisherman’s Bastion. According to legend, the Fisherman’s
          Bastion is protected by the Fisherman’s Guild, who are said to possess
          the power to control the waters of the Danube. <br />
          Another myth is about the famous thermal baths in Budapest, such as
          the Gellért Baths and the Rudas Baths. These baths are believed to
          have healing properties, and it is said that if you soak in the hot
          waters of the Rudas Baths on New Year’s Eve, you will be blessed with
          good health and good fortune in the coming year. <br />
          Finally, there is the legend of the “Turul” bird, a mythical bird that
          is said to bring good luck to the Hungarian people. The bird is
          depicted on the coat of arms of the city and can be seen on various
          monuments and buildings throughout Budapest.

      <div class="title">Heading South</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          Move a little away from the capital and head south, we arrive at Lake
          Balaton. According to legend, the lake was formed when a giant girl
          wept tears of sadness. The tears filled the low-lying area and formed
          the lake. This legend is still remembered and celebrated in the region
          today. If you're looking for a beautiful and relaxing vacation, Lake
          Balaton is the perfect destination. The northern side of the lake is
          particularly beautiful and boasts some of the most pristine and
          picturesque beaches in the region. In addition to the beaches, Lake
          Balaton is also famous for its vineyards, particularly those located
          in the Badacsony region. Some of the most famous vineyards in the area
          include Royal Tokaji, St. Andrea, and Hilltop.

      <div class="title">Badacsony, vineyard of vineyards</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          Badacsony is also the place for crazy parties, especially in summer.
          Larger groups come to the mountain for several days. It's a popular
          venue for stag and hen parties, company team-builders, wine tours. On
          a traditional Badacsony wine tour, you will arrive by ferry in the
          early hours of the morning. The aim is to visit (all) the wine
          cellars, drink at each one. Of course, the glory goes to the one who
          lasts the longest---on two legs. We usually drive up to the highest
          point of the mountain first, and from there the hike starts down. I
          find it much more comfortable and the experience is great. Meanwhile,
          we play games, like "truth or dare. In the afternoon, when we got back
          to the village from the mountain, the party starts, which lasts as
          long as people keep dancing. We usually spend the night in camping.
          The next morning, we have breakfast together at the local buffet, tell
          stories, take a bath in the lake, and head home. We call it a perfect
          weekend.

        <p>
          My other favourite region is Villány, a famous vine region in Hungary
          that is known for producing rich and full-bodied red wines. This
          region has a unique microclimate that is ideal for growing grape
          varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah. The wineries
          here are known for their traditional approach to winemaking, and many
          of them still use old-fashioned methods and techniques to produce
          their wines. Wine festivals are organised here every season which the
          locals love, including me.

      <div class="title">hungary's jewel box, Szentendre</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          Szentendre is a charming town located in Hungary, known for its rich
          cultural heritage and picturesque streets. It is situated along the
          Danube river and is home to a variety of museums, art galleries, and
          historic churches. The town has a unique Mediterranean atmosphere,
          with colourful buildings, cobblestone streets, and narrow alleys.
          Visitors can also explore the local artisan markets and enjoy
          traditional Hungarian cuisine. Additionally, Szentendre is a popular
          destination for day trips from Budapest, making it a convenient option
          for those looking to experience a little bit of Hungary's rural charm.
          Every time we arrive to this place we find something we did not see
          before. It’s a must-visit in my opinion.

      <div class="title">szeged: the kindest city of them all</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          Szeged is my all-time favourite Hungarian city. I had the privilege of
          attending university there and it holds a special place in my heart.
          The city has a rich cultural heritage, beautiful architecture and a
          thriving student life. This is the third-largest city in Hungary and
          is located in the southeast part of the country, near the Serbian
          border. The Tisza River runs through the city, providing a stunning
          backdrop for long walks and picnics in the parks. Is famous
          particularly for its local fish dishes, such as the famous
          "Fisherman's Soup". This amazing place is home to the country's
          largest university, the University of Szeged, which was founded in
          1872.

      <div class="title">different in many ways</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          Maybe I feel this because I have a special connection to this city,
          but in my opinion people are different here than anywhere else in
          Hungary. They are just different, but only in a positive way. A little
          nicer. A little happier. A little more understanding. A little more
          direct. If you are here, take note. The city literally bustles all
          year round. There's a constant series of events, festivals that last
          for weeks (!), celebrations in winter and summer. The cultural life
          and the university bustle is somehow different, more sophisticated,
          more magical. I have nothing bad to say about this place. Although I
          come from another place, this city is also my home.

      <div class="title">strand festival -yes!</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          My favourite summer festival is Strand Festival, which means “beach
          festival” in English. It’s held on the sandy shore of our biggest
          lake, Balaton and I love its atmosphere. It is similar to the other
          festivals, the music and the programmes are colourful, but the lake
          makes difference. There is nothing like when you sit on the lakeside
          at night, some rock band in the background, you just keep talking with
          your friends a little bit while the villages are sparkling on the
          other side of the lake. The festival is usually held on the State
          Foundation Day, 20 August, and ends with firework, marking the end of
          summer. <br />
          Oh, and this is where I was proposed to!
