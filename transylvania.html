      <h4>Mother and Me: A Journey of Adventure and Memories</h4>

      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          As a Hungarian, I have a special connection to the people and culture
          of Transylvania. When I first saw this region, I was blown away by its
          natural beauty and rich history. The rolling hills, pristine forests,
          and sparkling rivers are unlike anything I have ever seen before. And
          the traditional villages, with their warm and hospitable locals, are a
          window into a bygone era. For me visiting Transylvania with my mother
          made this trip one of my all-time favourite travel experiences as we
          created memories that will last a lifetime, and connected with each
          other on a deeper level.
        </p>

      <div class="title">Travel with your mom!</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          When you travel with your mom, you get to experience a different side
          of her and see her in a new light. You get to share experiences and
          explore new places together, and you get to grow closer and build a
          stronger relationship. Moreover, traveling with your mom provides a
          sense of comfort, safety, and security that is hard to find when
          you're traveling alone. There's something special about having your
          mom by your side, especially in new and unfamiliar environments.
          Allows you to gain a new appreciation for her, for her strength, her
          wisdom, and her unwavering support. It’s a time for you to reflect on
          all that she's done for you, and to express your gratitude in a
          meaningful way. I felt it important to mention this…

      <div class="title">First surprise: Cluj Napoca</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          Our journey began in Hungary, where we packed up the car and hit the
          road for an adventure. We travelled about 800 km to reach Harghita
          County. On the way we stopped to sleep in Cluj Napoca. Cluj-Napoca,
          located in the heart of Transylvania, is a city that constantly
          surprises its visitors. Upon arriving, I was taken aback by the mix of
          historical and modern architecture. The city is filled with towering
          skyscrapers, yet it still holds onto its rich cultural heritage and
          history. Cluj-Napoca is known for its cultural scene, with numerous
          festivals, concerts and events taking place throughout the year. It is
          also a hub for education, with several prestigious universities
          located in the city, including Babes-Bolyai University, one of the
          largest and oldest universities in Romania. Another interesting fact
          about Cluj-Napoca is that it was once part of the Dacian Kingdom, and
          there are several ancient ruins located in and around the city,
          including the remains of the Roman city of Napoca.

      <div class="title">Torda</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          We stopped by Torda rift, also known as the Torda Gorge, is a stunning
          geological formation located in the Transylvania region of Romania.
          This unique landscape is a result of the movement of tectonic plates
          and erosion by the river that runs through it, creating a breathtaking
          valley with towering cliffs and walls. This area has been inhabited by
          humans for thousands of years and has been the site of many battles
          and conflicts throughout its history. We saw remnants of
          fortifications and other historic structures, which provide a glimpse
          into the past of this region. For those who are visiting Torda Gorge,
          there is a tourist route that takes visitors through the heart of the
          canyon. There are options for longer or shorter routes depending on
          the level of difficulty and endurance you prefer. During our visit to
          Torda Gorge, my mom and I chose the shorter route as I didn't want her
          to get too tired. Despite its length, the route was incredibly
          beautiful and we were amazed by the towering cliffs, crystal-clear
          streams and lush greenery.

      <div class="title">Mistical Red Lake</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          Then we hit the road and didn't stop until we reached the Red Lake. It
          is a glacial lake and is one of the most famous natural attractions in
          the region, known for its stunning red-coloured waters, which are
          believed to be due to the high iron oxide content. Nothing is more
          proof of the magic of Romania than the legends and myths that surround
          it. According to the myth of the Red Lake, the lake's red colour is
          due to the blood of a young girl who was murdered and thrown into the
          lake.

      <div class="title">serpentine roads</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          On the other side of the lake you find Bicaz Gorge which is part of
          the Carpathian Mountains, and was created by the Bicaz River, which
          carved its way through the mountains over millions of years. The walls
          of the gorge rise up to 300 meters, making it one of the deepest
          gorges in Romania. The road that winds through the gorge is considered
          one of the most beautiful roads in Romania and I can tell you the
          truth: it really is! An interesting fact I learned there is that in
          the past, the Bicaz Gorge was used as a strategic military route, and
          there are several fortifications and military structures along the
          way.

      </div>
      <div class="title">the best for last</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          We stayed for the night at Glamping Suhardul Mic, next to Bicaz Gorge,
          which was the most amazing experience, I felt it was the crown for
          this journey with my mom. Even though it was September, and it was
          already chilly at night, we got a radiant heater which kept us
          perfectly warm in the barrel house. Imagine drinking your morning
          coffee on the terrace of a barrel house overlooking the Bicaz Gorge…
          <br />
          We had an early start back to Hungary the next day, unfortunately it
          was a short trip, but we know that we will be back! It is no question,
          I am already planning the next trip, and of course, I’m going with
          mom!
