      <h4>Sights, Sounds, and Stories: A Journey with My Brother</h4>

      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          This blogpost is to share with you my experience visiting London a few
          years ago with my little brother. We were both so excited to explore
          this beautiful city and we only had 4 days to do it, so we were
          constantly on the run. Despite the tight schedule, we managed to see
          and experience some truly amazing things. <br />
          London is home to over 8.9 million people, making it one of the
          largest cities in Europe. The city has a diverse population, with over
          300 languages spoken and a rich mix of cultures and traditions.
          Recently, the city has been impacted by Brexit, which has caused some
          changes to the way things are done in the city. The UK's exit from the
          European Union has resulted in new trade agreements, immigration
          policies, and changes to the economic landscape. Despite these
          changes, London remains a thriving hub of activity, with a rich
          history and a bright future ahead.

      <div class="title">Fist stop: CHINATOWN</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          One of the first things we stopped by was Chinatown, obviously. As we
          are both gourmets we couldn’t wait to try the food. Now that I think
          about is, when it comes to travel with my family, trying that nation’s
          food is always our first priority. So was it in London. <br />
          Located in the heart of London, Chinatown is a vibrant and bustling
          area filled with Chinese culture, history, and cuisine. As we walked
          through the streets, we were struck by the colourful lanterns, street
          signs, and the unmistakable aroma of delicious food wafting from the
          many restaurants. We stopped at one of the local restaurants and we
          finally tried the real Peking duck, the ancient dish that hails from
          Imperial Beijing. I am not exaggerating when I say that this was the
          highlight of our trip. We also tried some of the delicious pastries
          and sweets, which were a real treat.

          Chinatown is also home to the Chinese Arch, a traditional Chinese
          gateway that was gifted to the city by the people of Guangdong in
          1986. The arch serves as a symbol of friendship and cultural exchange
          between the UK and China, and is a popular spot for tourists and
          locals alike. In addition to its rich cultural heritage, Chinatown is
          also known for its bustling nightlife and vibrant festivals. One of
          the most famous is the Chinese New Year Festival, which is celebrated
          with dragon and lion dances, fireworks, and traditional food stalls.

        A Journey Through Time and Civilization: <br />
        the BRITISH MUSEUM
      </div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          Another one of the amazing places we visited during our trip to London
          was the British Museum. As one of the oldest and largest museums in
          the world, it is home to some of the most important and fascinating
          artifacts and exhibits from all over the globe. Here you can see the
          Rosetta Stone, which is considered one of the most important artifacts
          in the history of archaeology, or the Parthenon sculptures, also known
          as the Elgin Marbles, these were once part of the Parthenon temple in
          Athens, Greece.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class="title">Some things you may not know</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          While the British Museum is home to some of the most famous and
          well-known artifacts in the world, there are also many myths and
          historical facts that are not widely known. Here are a few that I
          found particularly fascinating during our visit: The Rosetta Stone was
          not discovered until 1799: Despite the stone's significance in
          deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, it was not discovered
          until late in the 18th century by a French soldier during Napoleon's
          campaign in Egypt. <br />
          The Parthenon sculptures have a controversial history: The Parthenon
          sculptures were acquired by the British Museum in the early 19th
          century and have been the subject of much controversy over the years.
          Some argue that they should be returned to Greece, while others
          believe that they are a part of the museum's collection and should
          remain on display.

          <br />
          The British Museum has a hidden crypt: Beneath the museum lies a
          hidden crypt, which was once used as a storage area for valuable and
          sensitive artifacts. The crypt is not open to the public, but it is
          said to contain some of the museum's most interesting and obscure
          objects.

      <div class="title">how to get to london?</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          As a student, my brother and I took a bus from Hungary to London
          because it was the most cost-effective option for us. At the time, we
          were on a tight budget and couldn't afford to fly. Looking back, I can
          say that the bus ride was an experience, but it was not the most
          comfortable one. It was cost-effective and convenient, however the
          journey was so long, I thought it would never end. The seats were
          cramped, and the lack of amenities such as WiFi and entertainment made
          the time seem to drag on. We were already tired before we got there.
          <br />
          Now, as an adult, I have a different perspective on travel. While cost
          is still important, comfort and convenience are also important
          factors. The next time I travel to London, I will definitely be
          choosing to fly. While it may be a more expensive option, I believe
          the benefits of a faster and more comfortable journey will be well
          worth it.

      <div class="title">TIPS FOR COST-EFFICIENCY</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          Whichever way you choose to travel I’ve collected some tips you can do
          to control your spending and make the journey more cost-efficient.
          <br />
          Book in advance: Booking your ticket well in advance can help you
          secure the best prices. <br />
          Pack wisely: Packing light can help you avoid paying baggage fees,
          which can add up quickly if you're traveling with multiple bags.
          <br />
          Bring food and snacks: Bringing your own snacks and drinks can help
          you save money and ensure that you have access to food that you like.
          <br />
          Plan ahead: Doing your research ahead of time can help you find the
          best deals on tickets, as well as help you plan your route and make
          the most of your time in London. <br />
          I would say the most important thing is to find a balance between
          cost-effectiveness and comfort. While it's important to control your
          spending, it's also important to ensure that you have a comfortable
          and enjoyable journey. By finding the right balance, you can ensure
          that you have a memorable trip to London without breaking the bank.

      <div class="title">Why to travel with siblings?</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          Traveling with my brother was my favourite thing about the whole
          journey. Firstly, I was able to share the experience with someone who
          was just as excited as I was. We were able to explore the city
          together, try new foods, and visit famous landmarks. It was a special
          time that we will both cherish forever. It also allows you to have
          someone to lean on when things go wrong. Whether it's getting lost,
          missing a bus, or dealing with unexpected weather, having someone by
          your side can make all the difference. Finally, it helped us build our
          teamwork skills. We had to work together to plan our itinerary, budget
          our time, and make decisions. This helped us learn to communicate
          effectively and work together towards a common goal.

      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          One of the highlights of our trip to London for me was visiting the
          Peter Pan statue in Kensington Gardens. Although it's not considered
          one of the main tourist attractions, it was important to me to see
          this statue for a personal reason. Standing in front of the statue, I
          felt a sense of nostalgia and joy. It was like I was transported back
          to my childhood, and I felt a connection to the inner child in me who
          still loves the magic and just like Peter, never wanted to grow up.
        </p>

      <div class="title">would I do it again?</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          Looking back on our trip to London, we have to admit that it was a
          total rush and a bit of a mess. We only had four days in the city and
          were constantly running around, trying to see all the mandatory sights
          and attractions. While it was great to see all these famous landmarks,
          I felt like we missed out on the real essence of the city. That's why
          we are determined to return to London and experience the city in a
          deeper, more meaningful way. I want to experience London both during
          the day and at night, to see the different sides of the city. I want
          to wander through its streets, sit in its cafes, and talk to its
          residents. In short, I want to feel the pulse of London and immerse
          myself in its unique atmosphere. I believe that this type of
          experience is the key to really understanding a city and its people,
          and I can't wait to return to London and do just that.
