      <h4>The Enchanted Home of Neverland</h4>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          In 2018 spring I moved to the Netherlands, and I was blown away by the
          country's commitment to sustainability, rich culture, and impeccable
          tidiness. During my stay, I visited Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Arnhem, and
          other smaller towns, each offering its own unique perspective on what
          makes the Netherlands such a special place. <br />
          One of the first things that caught my eye was the country's
          impressive sustainability efforts. The Netherlands is a world leader
          in sustainable practices, with a strong focus on renewable energy,
          clean water management, and reducing waste. <br />
          In fact, the country aims to become fully carbon neutral by 2050, and
          it is well on its way to reaching this goal. The widespread use of
          bikes and the development of bike lanes make it easier for people to
          get around while reducing their carbon footprint. Windmills, a symbol
          of Dutch heritage, are also a significant source of renewable energy
          in the country.

          Culture is another aspect that I found fascinating in the Netherlands.
          From the famous tulip gardens to the famous works of Vincent van Gogh,
          there is no shortage of cultural experiences in this country. Dutch
          cuisine, with its focus on seasonal ingredients and fresh flavours, is
          also a highlight of the country's cultural scene. The Dutch are proud
          of their cultural heritage, and it is reflected in their museums,
          festivals, and daily life. <br>
          Whether you're interested in music, art, food, or just soaking up the local culture, there's always something happening in this vibrant country.

            My all-time favourite celebration was undoubtedly King's Day (Koningsdag). Held annually on April 27th to mark the birthday of the current king, King's Day is a nationwide celebration filled with street parties, music, and other festivities.
            I arrived just in time for the festivities to begin and was immediately struck by the energy and excitement in the air. 
            The city was awash with orange, the national colour of the Netherlands, as people of all ages took to the streets to celebrate.
            One of the highlights of King's Day for me was the street market, where vendors sold everything from food and drinks to handmade crafts and vintage clothing. I was amazed at the variety of items on offer and the lively atmosphere of the market.
            Another highlight was the music, which was everywhere I turned. From street performers to DJ stages, the sounds of King's Day filled the air and kept the party going all day long. I especially enjoyed the live bands, which played everything from traditional Dutch folk music to contemporary pop and rock.

      <div class="title">the tidiest country i've seen so far</div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
          The tidiness of the Netherlands was something that I was not
          expecting. Everywhere I went, I saw well-maintained streets, tidy
          parks, and clean waterways. The Dutch have a strong sense of
          community, and it shows in their efforts to keep their cities and
          towns clean and beautiful. It was a pleasure to walk around and take
          in the sights and sounds of the country, and I couldn't help but feel
          a sense of pride in the way the Dutch care for their environment.

          The Netherlands borders the North Sea, which could be a little bit
          different “sea-experience” when you get there. It is obviously colder
          considering that is located in the North Atlantic Ocean, at a high
          latitude, which means that it is far from the equator and is exposed
          to cold, Arctic air masses. Additionally, the North Atlantic Drift, a
          warm ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico, does not
          reach the North Sea. Even though it may not have the average warmth of
          other seas, it can still be a rewarding and memorable experience.

          As I traveled through the cities and countryside of the Netherlands, I
          was struck by the unique way that modern and traditional buildings
          seem to coexist side by side. Whether you're in the bustling city of
          Amsterdam or a quaint village in the countryside, you'll see examples
          of both contemporary and historical architecture, each adding its own
          character and charm to the landscape. In the heart of Amsterdam,
          you'll find sleek, modern skyscrapers towering over quaint,
          centuries-old canal houses. Yet, despite their stark differences, both
          types of buildings seem to fit together seamlessly, creating a diverse
          and dynamic cityscape. Similarly, in the countryside, you'll find
          traditional thatched-roof farmhouses sitting next to sleek, modern
          wind turbines. The contrast between the two types of structures is
          striking, yet they seem to complement each other, creating a beautiful
          and harmonious landscape. It's a fascinating example of how the
          Netherlands has managed to embrace both its rich history and its
          forward-thinking, innovative spirit. This coexistence of modern and
          traditional architecture is a testament to the country's willingness
          to look towards the future while still honoring its past.

          One city
          that particularly stood out to me was Rotterdam, which is a prime
          example of the country's innovative spirit. From its cutting-edge
          architecture to its thriving port and thriving cultural scene,
          Rotterdam is a city that is constantly evolving and pushing the
          boundaries of what is possible. The city is home to some of the most
          impressive examples of modern architecture in the world, including the
          iconic Cube Houses and the Erasmus Bridge. In addition to its stunning
          architecture, Rotterdam is also home to a vibrant cultural scene, with
          world-class museums, theaters, and galleries. The city is also a hub
          for business and innovation, with a thriving port that is the gateway
          to Europe for many international companies.

          In conclusion, my trip to the Netherlands was an eye-opening
          experience. It's not only a must-see, but a must-stay! From its impressive sustainability efforts to its rich
          culture and impeccable tidiness, the country has left a lasting
          impression on me. Whether I was exploring the bustling streets of
          Amsterdam, admiring the modern architecture of Rotterdam, or taking in
          the beauty of the tulip gardens in Arnhem, I was continually amazed by
          what I saw. If you're looking for a destination that is both
          environmentally conscious and culturally rich, the Netherlands is a
          must-visit.
