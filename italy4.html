        <p>
            Genova, Genoa in Italian, is a city located in northwest Italy with a rich and fascinating history. Here are a few interesting historical facts you may know now:
            <br> The city was founded by the ancient Ligures people around the 4th century BC. It later became a Roman port and was known as "Genua" during Roman times.
            <br> Also played an important role in the Middle Ages as a major trading centre and port. It was a member of the powerful medieval maritime republic known as the Republic of Genoa, which controlled much of the Mediterranean trade.

            In the 13th century, Genova was a leading centre of banking and finance, and many of the city's wealthy merchants and bankers built lavish palaces, many of which still stand today.
            <br> This city was the birthplace of the famous explorer Christopher Columbus, who set sail from the city on his first voyage to the Americas in 1492, and home to many notable figures in art, literature, and science, including the artist Jan Vermeer, the poet Dante Alighieri, and the scientist Alessandro Volta.
           <br> During the 19th century, Genova experienced significant industrialization and modernization, particularly in shipbuilding and trade.

           <br> Another interesting fact that is known for the famous Lanterna, the oldest lighthouse in the Mediterranean, it's been shining since the 1st century A.D.
           <br>  We cannot avoid its historical and picturesque neighborhoods, like Boccadasse, Castelletto, and Nervi when it comes to Genova.
            Last but not least the city is also known for its famous pesto sauce, which is made with basil, garlic, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and olive oil, it's an important part of Genovese cuisine and culture.
