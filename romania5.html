        <p>
            Transylvania is a place that has long been shrouded in myths and stereotypes. From vampire legends to portrayals of Transylvanians as backward and superstitious, there are many misconceptions about this fascinating region that are simply not true. Here are a few examples of stereotypes about Transylvania that are not accurate.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
            One of the most pervasive stereotypes about Transylvania is that it is a land of vampires and other supernatural creatures. While it is true that Bram Stoker's 1897 novel "Dracula" was set in Transylvania, the idea that the region is overrun with blood-sucking monsters is simply not true. The vampire legend is a fiction, and Transylvania is not a place where you will find any kind of supernatural creature.
        </p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="/img/Transylvania/45.png" alt="Image 1" />
            <div class="description"></div>
          </div>
          
      </div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
            Another stereotype about Transylvania is that it is a place where people are backward and superstitious. This is not true. Transylvania has a rich history and culture, and its people are just as modern, educated and open-minded as anyone else in the world.
          <br><br>  There is a stereotype that is often associated with Transylvania is that it is a place of constant conflict and tension between ethnic Hungarians and Romanians. While it is true that there have been tensions between these two groups in the past, today the relationship between them is much more peaceful. The region is home to a diverse population of people from different ethnic and religious backgrounds who live and work together in harmony.
            
        </p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="/img/Transylvania/24.jpg" alt="Image 1" />
            <div class="description"></div>
          </div>
      </div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
            Lastly, Transylvania is often depicted as a remote and isolated place, with poor infrastructure and limited access to modern amenities. However, this is not the case. Transylvania is well-connected to the rest of Romania by road and rail, and it has a variety of accommodation options, from cozy guesthouses to luxurious resorts, as well as plenty of restaurants, bars and shops.
        </p>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="/img/Transylvania/20.jpg" alt="Image 1" />
            <div class="description"></div>
          </div>
          
      </div>
      <div class="content2">
        <p>
            The stereotypes and myths surrounding Transylvania are not true. This region is a place of natural beauty, rich history, and diverse culture. It has a modern and open-minded population that welcomes visitors with open arms. So don't let stereotypes stop you from visiting and discovering for yourself the real Transylvania.
